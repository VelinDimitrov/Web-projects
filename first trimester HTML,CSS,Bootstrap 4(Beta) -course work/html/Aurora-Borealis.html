        <h3 class="text-center">Aurora Borealis</h3>
        <div>
        <p>An aurora (plural: auroras),sometimes referred to as polar lights, northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) regions.Auroras are produced when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, mainly in the form of electrons and protons, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere) due to Earth's magnetic field, where their energy is lost.</p>
        <p>The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.</p>
        <p>Most auroras occur in a band known as the auroral zone, which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the geomagnetic poles at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the auroral oval, a band displaced towards the nightside of the Earth. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and S. Tromholt (1882) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone. Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the internet.</p>
        <p>Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be sub-visual.</p>
        <p>A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, and bring the aurora to lower latitudes. It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000 km away from the magnetic pole. The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval") is slightly different, being centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.</p>
        <p>In addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150 kHz known as auroral kilometric radiation AKR, discovered in 1972. Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space. X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Christ the Redeemer Statue, Brazil</h3>
        <p class="text-center">Located in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, Chichén Iyza is a world-famous complex of Mayan ruins which served as a religious, political and economic centre spanning from approximately 800 to 1200.
        Fact: The most recognisable step pyramid, known as El Castillo stands at 80 feet high.
        Fact: There are four sets of stairs, one on each side of the ruins. Each staircase has 91 steps, if you also include the top platform this equates to 365 in total - one for each day of the year.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Colosseum, Italy</h3>
        <p class="text-center">The majestic Colosseum was built in Rome in approximately AD70.
        Fact: It was used for many years as a stage for gladiator contests, group combats, battle re-enactments and other productions were performed to audiences of between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators.
        Fact: Over the years it has undergone structural work and battled the elements and to this date is one of Rome’s most popular tourist attractions.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center">Taj Mahal, India</h3>
        <p class="text-center">This stunning ivory-white marble mausoleum was built by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal (or Mogul) Emperor of India as a memorial to his deceased wife Mumtaz Maha.Fact: Construction of the Taj Mahal started on 1631 shortly after the passing of the Emperor’s wife and took more than two decades at a cost of 32 million rupees (today’s equivalent of $827 million).Fact: The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center">Great Wall of China</h3>
        <p class="text-center">The actual length of great wall is of great debate, with sources claiming anywhere from 4,000 – 13,170 miles in length.Fact: Contrary to popular belief the structure is not visible from outer space and is made up from several separate structures.Fact: The wall was originally built to protect the Chinese states and empires from invaders and raids, but also acts as a useful boarder control.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center">Petra, Jordan</h3>
        <p class="text-center">Petra, which is Greek for “rock,” is also known as “the city in the rock” or “Rose City” due to the colour of the sandstone cliffs it is carved from.Fact: The huge templates, tombs and monuments were not known to the western world until 1812.Fact: As well as the impressive rock carved city, Petra has a highly organised water system, which includes ceramic pipes, intricate water channels and cisterns; advanced for a city essentially carved into rocks.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center">Machu Picchu, Peru</h3>
        <p class="text-center">The ancient city if the Incas is located at an altitude of 7,710 feet, between two peaks; Machu Picchu (Old Peak) and Huayna Picchu (New Peak).Fact: The city was built around 1450 but abandoned due to the Spanish conquest a century later. American historian Hiram Bingham brought Machu Picchu to international attention in 1911.Fact: The city was home to approximately 1,200 residents at its peak.</p>
