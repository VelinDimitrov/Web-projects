            Hanson Robotics has enchanted and captured the imagination of the world with uncannily humanlike robots endowed with remarkable expressiveness, aesthetics, and interactivity. Our robots will soon engage and live with us to teach, serve, entertain, delight, and provide comforting companionship. In the not-too-distant future, Genius Machines will walk among us. They will be smart, kind, and wise. Together, man and machine will create a better future for the world.
            Hanson Robotics is partnering with SingularityNET, a platform for the decentralized AI economy.  SingularityNET is the first protocol for combining AI services with a global, blockchain-based market, and will soon be powering the minds of Hanson Robots. For more information please visit www.singularitynet.io.
            Hanson Robotics creates amazingly expressive and lifelike robots that build trusted and engaging relationships with people through conversation. Our robots teach, serve, entertain, and will in time come to truly understand and care about humans. We aim to create a better future for humanity by infusing artificial intelligence with kindness and empathy, cultivated through meaningful interactions between our robots and the individuals whose lives they touch. We envision that through symbiotic partnership with us, our robots will eventually evolve to become super intelligent genius machines that can help us solve the most challenging problems we face here in the world.
